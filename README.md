# My Reading List(s)

[![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)

This repository collects all the books I have read and I plan to read in the future. 

I usually get more books suggestions than I can read, so I wanted to centralize the list of books I want to read in a single place. Also, I hope that keeping track of books in lists can help me increase the number of books I read.

The big picture of my past, current and future readings can be seen from the [Kanban associated to this repository](https://github.com/warp10/reading-list/projects/1)

### Books suggestions
If you have great suggestions for new books, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/warp10/reading-list/issues). I'd be happy to hear your recommendations. The issue will be assigned to me when I start reading the book
